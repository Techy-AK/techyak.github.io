       <p> So , I am from Jharkhand , India and I belong to a middle class family and my name is Ankit Kumar who study in class 6 and I am 14 year old .So I got intrested in coding when my brother started a course in whitehat junior and I was eager to know what is coding. 
        So , From here I usually when my brother was doing his classes I use to sit next to him and understand
        and then I realised this is actual fun. Just from then I started learning coding and at first I learned html 
        then Python And then CSS so now I want to learn javascriptand this is my first most responsive webiste. <br> <br>
        So I got idea of making this website from when I had created a paid template for website which was cool. So I gone to my computer teacher Sir Alex and I asked what can I fix a rate for that template so he said " This is open source (Free) so ifyou put this on 9$ also there is very low chances to get it buyed you need customers for it ." Then I thought I must create a website which would be on the topic how to create a responsive website and ideas . So this is how I created this web but, I lost my template because I had made it on my father's school laptop and that laptop file's got corrupted because IDK :) ;) :( yeah when my father bringed it back (my father is  allowed to bringe laptop only when he have work of uploading ateendance or any excel related or any other work of school and I made it on that because my pc was disassembeld beacuse my mother had strictly told me to not focus on games till I clear netarhat exam which is in february month . Then yeah I had to follow that so I followed that till due to my sister's exam computer had to be assembled . Then I made this. <br>
